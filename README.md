# UFOs

## Part 1 - Overview of Project

Throughout the course of this assignment, the goal was to assemble an HTML page that will enable users to pull information from a javascript data file using filters. Filters were the most conducive method to use because there are various sightings that occurred throughout the U.S. (based on factors such as city or the shape of the sighting).

## Part 2 - Results and HTML Page

Upon navigating to the website, our client will see our basic opening and title with the picture at the top. Further down, there will be 5 filters to choose from: date, city, state, country, and shape. The HTML page will show all the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data and make the search results more precise to what the user is looking for.

## Part 3 - Conclusion

I have created a page that is easy to follow and allows the user to filter through the sightings in our data set using search bars. One drawback of our search bar is trying to validate the sightings that occurred, which can be outlined more thoroughly in the data. Being aware of how many people were at the siting would be a helpful element to validating claims. Having access to more relevant data would make the contents of the website more robust, enabling users to learn more. My recommendations for improving this website are as follows: 


  * Include data that communicates the number of people at each site
  * Add another filter to find the sightings by length
  * Have a site in constant moving state that would do the following: 
      * Update our data in real time
      * Add new sightings to our page as they arise
