# UFOs

## Part 1 - Overview of Project

Throughout the course of this assignment, the goal was to assemble an HTML page that will enable users to pull information from a javascript data file using filters. Filters were the most conducive method to use because there are various sightings that occurred throughout the U.S. (based on factors such as city or the shape of the sighting).

## Part 2 - Results and HTML Page

Upon navigating to the website, our client will see our basic opening and title with the picture at the top. Further down, there will be 5 filters to choose from: date, city, state, country, and shape. The HTML page will show all the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data and make the search results more precise to what the user is looking for.
