# UFOs

##Part 1 - Overview of Project

Throughout the course of this assignment, the goal was to assemble an HTML page that will enable users to pull information from a javascript data file using filters. Filters were the most conducive method to use because there are various sightings that occurred throughout the U.S. (based on factors such as city or the shape of the sighting).
